# car_app

fo the car app i did some search on animated games and other. in which i can move car by press the key left, right, top, bottom. in this way car can move to all diractions.

next, my app will start by a single page where we can see to start game sound settings and other menu.
moreover, in the starting it will count 1 to 3 and then start moving.
it takes brake with back key.
it would have a racing metter qwhich will show it's speed.
